# Build Your Own Huffman Coding Application

## Description

I’ve developed a Python application that implements *Huffman Coding*, a popular and efficient algorithm for data compression. The goal of this project was to build a customizable solution that allows users to encode and decode data based on their specific input, achieving optimal data storage by representing characters with variable-length codes.


## Problem Statement

The challenge here is to build an optimal Python solution for Huffman Coding. Given a set of characters and their frequencies, the application should construct a Huffman tree and generate the shortest possible binary code for each character. The solution should then allow encoding and decoding of input strings based on the generated Huffman codes.


## Steps for Solution

- Node Representation: Create a class to represent a node in the Huffman tree, which will store a character, its frequency, and pointers to its left and right children.

- Building the Tree: Write a function that constructs the Huffman tree by repeatedly combining the two nodes with the lowest frequencies until only one tree remains.

- Generating Codes: Create a function that traverses the tree to generate the Huffman codes for each character. This will involve a recursive approach that assigns ‘0’ for left traversal and ‘1’ for right traversal.

- Encoding: Develop a method to encode input strings using the Huffman codes generated from the tree.

- Decoding: Implement the decoding function that takes an encoded binary string and reconstructs the original input string using the Huffman tree.

- Testing: Ensure the code is tested with different input data, verifying the correctness of both encoding and decoding processes.
